"exp_2.2   =>  Java Programs for Autoboxing, Serialization, and File-Based Data Management"
This repository contains practical Java programs demonstrating essential concepts in modern application development. You’ll find code examples that cover autoboxing and unboxing for efficient numeric data handling, serialization for object persistence, and file I/O for robust data management systems. Each exercise is designed to prepare you for real-world programming tasks by reinforcing skills in user input processing, object-oriented design, and file-based storage using Java’s standard libraries.

"exp_2.3  =>  Java Programs Using Lambda Expressions and Stream Operations"
This repository features practical Java programs that harness the power of lambda expressions and the Stream API for efficient data manipulation and analytics. You’ll learn to sort complex objects like employees using concise lambda-based comparators, filter and sort student lists functionally, and process large product datasets with diverse stream operations including grouping, aggregation, and mapping. Each exercise demonstrates modern, readable solutions for real-world tasks, merging object-oriented design with functional programming principles.
